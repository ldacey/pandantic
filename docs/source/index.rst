Welcome to Pandantic's documentation!
===================================

**Pandantic** introduces the ability to validate (`pandas`) DataFrames using
`pydantic.BaseModel`s. The `pandantic` package is using the V2 version of
`pydantic` as it has significant improvements over its V1 versions
(a performance increase up to 50 times).

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
